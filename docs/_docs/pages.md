Pages are the most basic building block for content. They're useful for
standalone content (content which is not date based or is not a group of
content such as staff members or recipes).

The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the root
directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown
using a `.md` extension and [front matter](/docs/front-matter/), which
converts to HTML on build. For a site with a homepage, an about page, and a
contact page, here's what the root directory and associated URLs might look
like:

```
.
├── about.md      # => http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # => http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
```

If you have a lot of pages, you can organize them into subfolders. The same
subfolders that are used to group your pages in your project's source will
then exist in the `_site` folder when your site builds:

```
.
├── about.md          # => http://example.com/about.html
├── documentation     # folder containing pages
│   └── doc1.md       # => http://example.com/documentation/doc1.html
├── design            # folder containing pages
│   └── draft.md      # => http://example.com/design/draft.html
```

Remember that a page is only processed if it begins with front matter — a
Markdown file without one is copied through as a
[static file](/docs/static-files/), unless the
[jekyll-optional-front-matter plugin](/docs/plugins/) is enabled.

## Changing the output URL

You might want to have a particular folder structure for your source files
that changes for the built site. With [permalinks](/docs/permalinks/) you
have full control of the output URL.

## Excerpts for pages

Pages have an `excerpt` variable just like posts — by default the first
paragraph of content. (In Jekyll this requires setting `page_excerpts: true`;
in Jigyll it is always available.)
