description: The layout of a Jigyll site's source directory, and where caches live.
---

A basic Jigyll site usually looks something like this:

```
.
├── _config.yml
├── _data
│   └── members.yml
├── _drafts
│   ├── 2026-07-01-begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md
│   └── 2026-07-03-on-simplicity-in-technology.md
├── _includes
│   ├── footer.html
│   └── header.html
├── _layouts
│   ├── default.html
│   └── post.html
├── _posts
│   ├── 2025-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md
│   └── 2026-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md
├── _sass
│   ├── _base.scss
│   └── _layout.scss
├── _site
└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid front matter
```

> **Differs from Jekyll.** No `.jekyll-cache`, `.sass-cache`, or
> `.jekyll-metadata` is ever created in your project. Jigyll's build cache
> lives outside the source tree, in `jigyll-$USER` under the system temp
> directory (`$TMPDIR` on macOS, `/tmp` on Linux). Set the
> `JIGYLL_DISABLE_CACHE` environment variable to turn it off. Note the draft
> filenames above carry date prefixes — [Jigyll requires
> them](/docs/posts/#drafts), unlike Jekyll.

An overview of what each of these does:

| File / Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_config.yml` | Stores [configuration](/docs/configuration/) data. Many of these options can be specified from the command line, but it's easier to specify them here so you don't have to remember them. |
| `_drafts` | Drafts are unpublished posts. Learn how to [work with drafts](/docs/posts/#drafts). |
| `_includes` | These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse. The Liquid tag `{% raw %}{% include file.ext %}{% endraw %}` can be used to include the partial in `_includes/file.ext`. |
| `_layouts` | These are the templates that wrap posts and pages. Layouts are chosen on a page-by-page basis in the [front matter](/docs/front-matter/). The Liquid tag `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` is used to inject content into the web page. |
| `_posts` | Your dynamic content: blog posts. The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. The [permalinks](/docs/permalinks/) can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name. |
| `_data` | Well-formatted site data should be placed here. Jigyll autoloads `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, and `.csv` files in this directory (top level only — [no subfolders](/docs/datafiles/)), accessible via `site.data`. |
| `_sass` | These are Sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss`, which is then processed into a single stylesheet. See [assets](/docs/assets/). |
| `_site` | This is where the generated site is placed when you run `jigyll build`. It's a good idea to add this to your `.gitignore` file. Note that `jigyll serve` renders entirely in memory and never writes here. |
| `index.html` or `index.md`, and other HTML/Markdown files | Provided that the file has a [front matter](/docs/front-matter/) section, it will be transformed by Jigyll. |
| Other files/folders | Except for the special cases listed above, every other directory and file — `css`, `images`, `favicon.ico`, and so forth — is copied verbatim to the generated site as a [static file](/docs/static-files/). |

Every file or directory beginning with `.`, `_`, `#`, or `~` in the source
directory is excluded from the destination. Such paths have to be explicitly
listed in the config file under the `include` key to make sure they're
copied over:

```yaml
include:
  - _pages
  - .htaccess
```
